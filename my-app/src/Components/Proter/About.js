                        <p>I was fortunate enough to complete my studies with First Class Honours from the University of Edinburgh in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey and through some hands-on experiences, I've grown fond of front-end engineering and have had the opportunity to familiarize myself with tools like React.js and Vue.js. I've also delved into blockchain technologies, gaining understanding of Solidity and Ethereum.</p>

                        <p class="mt-4">While I feel I've learned a lot, I believe there's always room for growth. I find myself drawn to environments that constantly challenge and evolve, hoping to contribute in any way I can. I would love the chance to be a part of a startup culture where I can lend my skills to meaningful projects. More than anything, I hope to find a place where the work resonates with my own values.</p>

                        <p class="mt-4">In some recent projects, I tried my hand at developing a unique version of a Twitter-like platform, which ranks tweets based on the Ethereum in a user's wallet. I also worked on Proter, which is a discrete event simulator for modeling workflows, and had an attempt at implementing the game GO in Solidity. These experiences have been valuable lessons in thinking differently and striving for results.</p>

                        <p class="mt-4">Outside the tech world, I've been fortunate to be a part of some great teams and communities. For instance, I contributed in a small way to the Edinburgh Universityâ€™s Swing Dance Society and have cherished memories with the Scouts, where I was honored with the Duke of Edinburgh awards. These experiences have been pivotal in teaching me the importance of collaboration and understanding.</p>

                        <p class="mt-4">I would love the opportunity to work alongside innovative teams to contribute to solutions that can make a difference. I'm driven by a desire to do good work, stay committed to quality, and offer whatever skills I've gathered so far. I'm hopeful about the potential collaborations ahead.</p>
